# Day 12

VISION: YES. The September play-camera shot is a sand ring filling the frame, a white rail and a dark kick board across the back, and a scoreboard that still says walk to the start flags. The horse is only a dark edge at the left.

Started 2026-10-06 00:23 local. Morning is 07:00. Windowed runs stop at 05:45.

## Status

## Decisions

- Seat-probe Godot PIDs 114976 and 115652 have been up since 2026-10-04 21:47 with working sets under 4 MB. This night did not start them and did not kill them. New runs still launch. One new Godot at a time besides those two.
- `--ridecert-fresh` logs to `dist/ridecert_fresh.log`. T0 copies are `dist/day12/<id>.T0.log`.
- Save snapshot is `dist/day12/save_snapshot.json` and is not committed. It matched after compile, playtest, and all three rides.
